# Crane 2.0

Crane 2.0 cli

TODO: Add section explaining what this is

## Getting Started

Crane is available via source, so it must be built. A user is expected to have
a usable go build environment on their workstation.

First, checkout crane into your `GOPATH`:

```
mkdir -p $GOPATH/konveyor
git clone https://github.com/konveyor/crane.git $GOPATH/konveyor/crane
```

The following command will build the crane binary, which can be moved to a user's
PATH for regular usage:

`go build -o crane main.go`

## Usage
